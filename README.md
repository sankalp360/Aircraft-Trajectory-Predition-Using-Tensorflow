Problem topic: Clustering of air objects based on its trajectory : By DRDO

We are making a web application based project which will show the clustered air object and predict its trajectory on the basis of data based on previous trajectories. The technology, we are dealing with is machine learning and neural network. Also, flask and mySQL connectivity is used in backend.
